default delimiter to put
all files array
saving delimiter in 'read' command
and chaging it to \n, cause it should read the whole string
should we left the temp files?







































if it exists
and readable
workf[@]}]=$1 #add it to array of our working files









if it is not empty, set delimiter






parameter processing loop








we should left the temp files


all other is our potential working files





for every of our working files
array of comment strings
array of code strings
maximal length of our code(members of cod)
the size of our arrays

change all tabs to 4 spaces ~ expand $i

create all temp files


# reading string by string
take only code

only comments

cod[filen]} -gt $maxlen ]]; then #find maxlen
cod[filen]}


fulfill our files



#from this file

create our result file

fulfill it straight with delimiters
cod[j]}+3))





making right amount of spaces for every string 


adding string to file


deleting temp files



deleting arrays for this loop



setting our 'read' delimiter to previous
